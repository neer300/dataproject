@Plaid_Pope "Your holiness, welcome to Twitter. Our relations with the Vatican are at their best and can form a basis to further peace"
Even the Pope has a twitter account now.  I guess that means it's not hip anymore. http://t.co/CfB08e6V
@PresidentPeres welcomes Pope @Pontifex to Twitter "I have highest regard for His Holiness + I was glad to see he started to Tweet" #jpost
My wife tells me the Pope is going to be on Twitter.  How refreshing to have a clergyman express his thoughts in 140 characters or less.

Why is this from sci/tech? @RichardDawkins RT @fxnscitech: Pope's Twitter is handle @Pontifex, 1st Tweet Dec. 12 will be a Q&amp;A format

Pope Benedict is now on Twitter, in English at @pontifex and in Arabic at @pontifex_ar. Kudos to Vatican's PR dept for reaching out to MENA
