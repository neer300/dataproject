@didairshaid
Israel has been patient/not turn Gaza into a parking lot.It's not easy take out Hamas fighters when they hide behind civilians.
@didairshaid
Israel wouldn't be hitting targets in Gaza,if Hamas wasn't firing rockets into Israel. Israel is not the one randomly firing.
@didairshaid
The only reason Israel is blockading (Weapons only) is Gaza keep up a constant harassing barrage of rocket fire into Israel.

Aggressor??How many rockets out of Gaza,sense Israel turn over control to them?Israel could flatten Gaza.
