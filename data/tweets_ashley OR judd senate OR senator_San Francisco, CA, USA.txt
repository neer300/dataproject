ashley OR judd senate OR senator
I hear Ashley Judd might run for senate.  All I have to say is "I'd like to have sex with her."
I would like to see Ashley Judd run for senator against Senator McConnell in 2014.
I bet most of McConnell's attack ads would be scenes of Judd freaking out in BUG: http://t.co/bbUCCCah
