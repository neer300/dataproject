@SabrinaJeninA since Israel left Gaza in '05, thousands of rockets were launched at Israeli cities &amp; towns. What's that say about Hamas?
@SabrinaJeninA attacks on the Israeli security fence near Gaza are hardly benevolent. And seems like your forgetting the 2005 disengagement
@SabrinaJeninA #FactCheck Gaza City is less densely populated than multiple cities, including Tel Aviv. Which was fired upon by Hamas.
@SabrinaJeninA then inquire why that happened. 14k+ rockets on Israeli civilians, w/terrorist weapons and assets in Gaza urban areas

Gaza is independent but why don't they build life there and florish? it can be paradise. Instead they residents are forced to comply w/ war
