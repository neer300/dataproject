The Pope has joined Twitter. No tweets yet. Close to 500,000 followers. Not sure why this surprises people - that's how religion works.

I think Pope Benedict has made a huge mistake making a Twitter account. He's already been mocked without making a tweet.

RT @M_W_Oh: The Pope has joined twitter. His reasoning is that he wants to lead the Worlds Catholics in One Direction.
Pope comes to Twitter. Cries of 'papists!' and 'popery!' ensue as the pastier white folk channel their ancestors and tweet like it's 1599.
@jesusplaysNRL Have to mind your language now My Lord as the Pope has joined twitter and is following you.
