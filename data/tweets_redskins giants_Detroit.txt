Nasty brawl in the stands b/w Redskins-Giants fans. http://t.co/UeVBiw6v
Watched a bit of "First Take" &amp; @RealSkipBayless is giving RGIII a lot of big time love after last night's @Redskins win over @Giants. SMH
Not a Redskins fan but I'm happy that their franchise has something to be excited about now thanks to #RG3. Good job downing the #Giants.

Nice drive....Touchdown Redskins....like I said Giants allowed this game to stay close...due to settling for FGs instead of TDs.

Missed opportunity by the Redskins to make their lead bigger....Giants defense giving the offense another opportunity.
Very smart playcalling for the Giants to go deep vs. the Redskins bad secondary. Done so a couple of times on this drive.
