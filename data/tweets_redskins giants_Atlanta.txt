redskins beat the giants? good!
Glad the Redskins beat them punk ass GIANTS lol
Wow, you go Redskins! Thanks for showing the @Atlanta_Falcons how to take down the giants! We'll finish them off in 2 weeks!
I don't want to hear about RG3.  He is a good QB, but the Giants lack of offense won the Redskins the game.
So all the Falcons have to do is hold the Giants back like the Redskins did and we will BEAT them TOO! #RISEUP
