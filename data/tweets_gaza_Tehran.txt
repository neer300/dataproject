@MacrosTh3Black Don't know WTF happened there. US / Canada should've used occasion to balance support of Gaza attack with support of Abbas.
@MacrosTh3Black Can't happen with Hamas driving in Gaza: The hardliners on each side support each other, just like in the Cold War.
@MacrosTh3Black Settlements please Bibi supporters, upset by outcome of Gaza attack, for short term (Jan 22 election).
@MacrosTh3Black #Bibi didn't get Presidl election bounce he was hopg for from attack on #Gaza, then there was that nasty #UNGA thing, so....
