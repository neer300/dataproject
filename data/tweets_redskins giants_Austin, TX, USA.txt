redskins giants
Lost job @Daily. Watched @Redskins beat Giants. Granddad, observing from Heaven, calls Monday a push.
Blindside RT @ESPNStatsInfo: Last time Redskins beat Giants on MNF was game in which Joe Theismann had his leg broken by Lawrence Taylor.
RT @Texas_Mike13: I'd rather Redskins win the division than giants or cowboys.
I know a lot of Cowboys fans are happy the Redskins beat the Giants. Before u start shooting your guns in the air, we've got the tiebreaker.
Good job, Redskins. Can't stand the Giants.
@Emalicious89 but I was hoping for the Giants to  win even if that met for my team to be in last.Im still not a redskins fan but he did good
Cowboys one game behind giants. NFC east just got good. Redskins are in it too
@RealSkipBayless @stephenasmith please caption this photo tomorrow! #nfl #mnf #espn #giants #redskins http://t.co/dFaZSNx7
‚Äú@NovmbrGrl: @DUSTIN_RHODES1 Redskins beat the Giants 17-16‚Äùty
Redskins beat Giants 17 to 16. RG3 is amazing!
Could someone explain to me why the Giants didn't allow the Redskins to score? Only chance they had to win the game. Dumb coaching.
RT @SigmundBloom: Looks like #redskins will have tiebreakers on #giants in division race. Could get interesting

Giants&gt;Redskins
Ugh, pulling for the Giants because I dislike them slightly less than the Redskins.
Because the Redskins defense cannot stop the Giants, barring something catastrophic, this game is over.

If the Eagles can't make the playoffs I don't want cowboys or giants Redskins to win sb either.
